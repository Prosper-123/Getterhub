            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            </p>

            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>
                Aliko Dangote was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. From a young age, he showed a keen interest 
                in computers and programming. He attended Harvard University but dropped out to pursue his passion for

            <blockquote>
                "Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose." – Bill Gates
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Building Microsoft</h2>
            <p>
                Microsoft revolutionized the personal computing industry with the launch of Windows, an operating system 
                that became the standard for PCs worldwide. Gates' vision and leadership helped Microsoft grow into a

            <p>
                After stepping down as CEO of Microsoft, Gates shifted his focus to philanthropy. Along with his wife, 
                Melinda, he established the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which works to improve healthcare, reduce 
                poverty, and expand educational opportunities around the world.
